ABOUT
-----

The Tomcat redirector was developed using Visual C++ Ver.6.0, 
so having this environment is a prerequisite if you want to perform 
a custom build.

REQUIREMENT
-----------

* MS VC 6.0 (+ update, latest service pack is sp5)
  isapi_redirector.dll can be built using the command line tools, or 
  from within the Visual Studio IDE Workbench. The command line build 
  requires the environment to reflect the PATH, INCLUDE, LIB and other 
  variables that can be configured with the vcvars32 batch file: 
  
  "c:\Program Files\DevStudio\VC\Bin\vcvars32.bat"

* MS PLATFORM SDK
  Visual C++ 6.0 builds require an updated Microsoft Windows Platform SDK 
  (http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/) to enable 
  some isapi_redirector.dll features. For command line builds,
  the Platform SDK environment is prepared by the setenv batch file:
  
  "c:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK\setenv.bat"

  Note that the Windows Platform SDK is only needed if you want authenticate 
  using IIS to compile a isapi_redirector.dll.. 



BUILDING
--------
 
The steps that you need to take are:

   1. Change directory to the isapi redirector plugins source directory.
   
   2. Execute the following command:
      nmake -f Makefile.x86 [SO_VERSION=-1.2.31]

An alternative will be to open the isapi workspace file (isapi.dsw) in msdev and 
build it using the build menu.
